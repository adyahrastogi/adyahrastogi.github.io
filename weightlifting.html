            <p>
                I am a vegetarian who enjoys going to the gym to do weightlifting. This page is to answer common questions about following a vegetarian diet while weightlifting. It will talk about how to get enough protein, managing the different nutrients needed, and general tips.

                        <td>Can vegetarians build muscle as effectively as meat-eaters?</td>
                        <td>Yes, muscle growth depends on progressive resistance training and sufficient protein intake. If you stick to a diet with enough protein and balance and a progressive overload training plan, vegetarians can also gain strength/build muscle as effectively as meat-eaters.</td>

                        <td>How much protein do I really need?</td>
                        <td>Aim for 0.7-1.0 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day. For a 150lb lifter, that would be 105-150g of protein spread throughout the day.</td>

                        <td>What is a complete protein?</td>
                        <td>A food is a complete protein when it contains all nine of the essential amino acids necessary in human diet. This includes eggs, dairy, soy products, quinoa, buckwheat, and hemp. Some common vegetarian incomplete protein sources include nuts and seeds, whole grains, vegetables, and legumes. However, as long as you eat a variety of complete + incomplete proteins, your body will be able to form complete proteins. For example, beans and grains can be paired to make a complete protein.</td>

                    <tr>
                        <td>Do I need to use protein powder as a vegetarian?</td>
                        <td>It is not strictly necessary to use protein powder on your weightlifting journey as a vegetarian as long as you prioritize protein in your diet. Otherwise, it is perfectly good to help boost your protein intake with protein powder, especially on days when you have less time to cook protein heavy meals.</td>

                    <tr>
                        <td>Can I get enough iron on a vegetarian diet?</td>
                        <td>Though plant iron is absorbed less efficiently than meat based iron, you can definitely get enough iron on a vegetarian diet through lentils, spinach, beans. Try pairing these foods with vitamin C rich foods like bell peppers or citrus to boost the iron's absorption.</td>

                    <tr>
                        <td>Should I use creatine? Is it vegetarian-friendly?</td>
                        <td>Yes! Most creatine powders are synthetic. Creatine improves strength, power/energy, muscle growth, and has even been linked to improved cognitive function. It's been studied to be especially helpful in vegetarian diets, as vegetarians do not get creatine from their diet naturally, unlike meat-eaters.</td>

                    <tr>
                        <td>Do soy products affect hormone levels?</td>
                        <td>There are some beliefs that eating soy products affects hormones, but a moderate intake of soy is safe and studies do show that soy protein does not reduce testosterone or worsen strength gains.</td>

                        <td>What are some good high-calorie vegetarian foods for bulking?</td>
                        <td>Nuts, seeds, avocado, olive oil, whole grains, and full-fat dairy like yogurt and cheese are great high-calorie foods for bulking!</td>

                    <tr>
                        <td>What's the biggest tip for vegetarian lifters?</td>
                        <td>Tracking nutrition at first to make sure you're eating enough protein and calories to grow stronger is really helpful. It can be harder for vegetarians to get enough protein on a daily basis compared to meat-eaters, so it helps a lot, especially in the beginning, to track your protein intake.</td>
